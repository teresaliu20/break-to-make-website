        <div class="question-block">
            <h3 class="question">WHAT DO PARTICIPANTS MAKE AT A MAKEATHON?</h3>
            <p class="question-answer">CAD and Arduino type workshops will bring participants up to speed with modeling softwares and electronics used in the product design process. With access to prototyping materials during the makeathon, participants will be encouraged to bring their own projects or participate in the general challenge. Teams will have the opportunity to pitch and demo their finished projects to fellow attendees and judges.</p>

            <h3 class="question">WHY ALL-WOMEN?</h3>
            <p class="question-answer">Our makeathon removes the pressure of being pigeonholed into gender-biased roles or intimidated by a need to prove themselves on attendees, reshaping the language and culture at such events. Creating an all-women event fosters a friendlier learning environment, eventually acting as a springboard for attendees to return as participants or mentors at our Spring Co-Ed Makeathon.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question-block">
            <h3 class="question">HOW CAN I ATTEND?</h3>
            <p class="question-answer">Registration is set to open in early August. Keep your eyes peeled on Spark SC's Facebook page for updates!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question-block">
            <h3 class="question">HOW CAN I HELP SUPPORT THIS EVENT?</h3>
            <p class="question-answer">Whether it be leading a workshop or sending hardware for us to hack on, you are not restricted to a sponsorship level, and there are many other ways to support a makeathon besides monetary sponsorship. We would be happy to discuss ways that you can help Break to Make and ways that we can help you! If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail us at makeathon@sparksc.org.</p>
