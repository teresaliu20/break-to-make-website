# Break To Make

Break to Make is an all-women makeathon at USC. Join us on September 23 - 24 in breaking the mold to make the future. Around 200 female college engineers, architects, designers, and makers in California join in Los Angeles for a weekend to build hardware projects. In addition, we will bring in mentors and panelists for talks and workshops and connects female makers to each other early in their college careers. By giving women resources to move forward with projects and building a community for female makers, weâ€™re empowering participants to return for our Spring Co-Ed Makeathon.
